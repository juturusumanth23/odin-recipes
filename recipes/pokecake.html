        <li>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin mix</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>

        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="recipelist">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Beat cake mix, 1 cup water, eggs, oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 21 to 26 minutes. Use a fork or chopstick to poke holes in cake; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining 1 cup water into a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir in strawberry gelatin mix until dissolved. Mix in 1/4 cup cold water. Pour over cake. Refrigerate soaked cake until completely cool, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Make topping: Whisk together milk and lemon pudding mix in a bowl until slightly thickened. Fold in whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Frost cooled cake with topping; store in the refrigerator. Top with whole or sliced strawberries when ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
